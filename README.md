# Customer-Management-system

In this project, I build an application capable of managing clients,
each of those authorized to the system may enter a client into the system,
and add a task to be performed for a client, this system organizes the information on an ongoing basis,
and each person who uses it will be able to accurately know to whom the task belongs, what the task is, and when it needs to be performed her.

Languages I used:

Server side - Node.js, Client side - Angular, Typescript.

database : phpMyAdmin.
